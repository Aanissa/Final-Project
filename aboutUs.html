        <h2>This website was created by Anissa Arakal, Jessenia Mayancela, and Aileen Park.
These three girls were a part of the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program hosted at Microsoft Technology Center in 2017.
The final project was to create a product, a game in Scratch or Python or a website using HTML and CSS, in the final two weeks of the program.
After doing research on topics they were passionate about, ideas were pitched and this trio was formed.
Their focus was on students who are looking for opportunities.
After several discussions, they decided to focus on volunteer opportunities in New York and its five boroughs.
They hope that all the users will benefit greatly from their project!
